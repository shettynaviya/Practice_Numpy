# 🧮 Practice_Numpy

This repository contains my hands-on practice and learning exercises with **NumPy**, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It includes basic to intermediate concepts, covering a wide range of NumPy functionalities with examples.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- NumPy Array creation (`array`, `arange`, `linspace`, etc.)
- Array indexing and slicing
- Array reshaping and transposing
- Broadcasting and vectorized operations
- Mathematical and statistical operations
- Aggregation functions (`sum`, `mean`, `std`, etc.)
- Random number generation using `numpy.random`
- Logical operations and masking
- Working with multidimensional arrays
- Performance comparisons with Python lists
- Practical examples and mini tasks

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy (latest version recommended)

You can install NumPy using pip if not already installed:

## 🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shettynaviya/Practice_Numpy.git
cd Practice_Numpy
Open any .ipynb or .py file to explore NumPy concepts in detail.

Run the notebooks or scripts using your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or any IDE).

## 📌 Purpose
This repository is purely for educational and self-learning purposes. It serves as a reference for revisiting core NumPy concepts and examples when needed.

## 📁 Structure
The repo may include:

numpy_basics.ipynb: Getting started with arrays and basic operations

numpy_random.ipynb: Working with random numbers

performance_comparison.py: Comparing speed of NumPy arrays vs Python lists

Additional practice files and topic-based exercises
